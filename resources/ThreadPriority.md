### Thread Priority

* Let's say there are 10 threads in runnable state, however, there is only one available CPU, so only one thread can execute at a given time and others will have to wait.

* So who decides which thread gets to run on the CPU. This component is called as `Thread Scheduler`.

* Each thread has certain priority and under normal circumstance the thread with higher priority gets to run on the CPU.

* Priority value from 1 to 10 can be assigned to any thread.

* 1 priority is represented as `MIN_PRIORITY` and 10 priority is represented as `MAX_PRIORITY`. By default, the priority of a thread is 5, it's represented as `NORM_PRIORITY`.

* Threads of the same priority value are executed in `FIFO` manner. The thread scheduler stores the threads in a queue.
