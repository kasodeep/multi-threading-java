### Implementing Runnable Vs Extending Thread class

* Which approach is better?
    * If we extend Thread then we can't extend any other class, usually a big disadvantage.
    *  However, a class may implement more than one interface, so while using Implements Runnable approach there is no
       restriction to extension of class now or in the future.
